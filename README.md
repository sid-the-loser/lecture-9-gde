## Gameloop

Car moves around. Avoid all the red cars using WASD!

## What did I learn

I learnt how to use the object pooling and dirty flags method in Godot. Both pooling and dirty flag is set in object pooling script in scripts folder. I could've added more to the game, such as a fuel car and a game over if I had a bit more time or if I was quick with the implementation.
